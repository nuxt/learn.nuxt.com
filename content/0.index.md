# Welcome to Nuxt Tutorial!

This is an interactive tutorial that is composed with guides and challenges to help you learn [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and its concepts step by step.

The goal of this tutorial is to quickly give you an experience of what it feels like to work with Nuxt and Vue, **right in the browser**. It does not aim to be comprehensive, and you don't need to understand everything before moving on. All playgrounds are editable with a full-featured editor and dev environment, so you can play with the code and see the result right away and learn by doing.

## What's Nuxt?

Nuxt is a free and [open-source framework](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) with an intuitive and extendable way to create type-safe, performant and production-grade full-stack web applications and websites with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). Nuxt has no vendor lock-in, allowing you to deploy your application [**everywhere, even on the edge**](https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge).

## Getting Started

With this tutorial, we assume you are already familiar with the basic concept of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Nuxt is a full-stack framework built on top of [Vue](https://vuejs.org), we also include a simple Vue tutorial to help you get started quickly.

## About This Playground

This playground itself is also built with Nuxt. It uses:

- [WebContainers](https://webcontainers.io/) to create a fully-featured Node.js environment in your browser to run Nuxt dev server.
- [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) to provide content management for the playground.
- [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) to provide a code editor with syntax highlighting and code completion.
- [Volar](https://github.com/volarjs/volar.js) to provide Vue and TypeScript language support for Monaco Editor.

You can find the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/nuxt/learn.nuxt.com) to learn more about how this playground is built.
