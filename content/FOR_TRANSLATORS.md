Hey! Thanks for being interested in helping translate the Nuxt Tutorial.

However, please note that currently we are focusing only on the English version and Japanese version.

We are NOT accepting translations for other languages at this moment due to the limited resources.

Feel free to fork the repository and deploy your own version of the website.
But please do not send translation PRs for now.

After we finishing writing the content, we might start considering supporting other languages.

Thank you for your understanding.
